## DIABETIES-PREDICTION-DL

This project is on predicting diabeties in patients. model is trained on dataset " https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database ".

Also main objective is to learn different regularization techniques to handle overfitting problem and their impact on prediction. so i run the same model for 4 different regularization techniques:

    1) L1 regularization

    2) L2 regularization

    3) Early stopping

    4) Droupout

## RESULTS
